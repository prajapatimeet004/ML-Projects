# ML-Projects
Developed and evaluated various supervised learning models including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Decision Trees using Python.

Applied models on real-world datasets for both regression and classification tasks.

Used different data splitting techniques (train-test split, cross-validation) to compare model performance.

Fine-tuned model parameters to improve accuracy and overall performance.

Leveraged libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualization.
